    <i>A demo of <b>client-side SQLite</b> for the web.</i>

    <h2>What is <q>client-side SQLite</q>?</h2>
    <p>It began with a seemingly-simple question: <q>How can I query my database
    without having to run a database server on my server?</q></p>

    <p>The most straightforward answer to the question is to make clients
    download the whole database and query it, which becomes impractical as the
    database grows.</p>

    <p>My solution is, using <a href="https://github.com/kripken/sql.js">sql.js</a>
    (SQLite compiled to JavaScript through Emscripten), <i>download the database as
    the database file is accessed</i>. Laziness is achieved by HTTP Range requests.</p>


    <h2>Neat, but what else?</h2>
    <p>I think the real significance of this project is how it reduces the
    cost of running a service that requires a database. Given the prevalence of
    free static file hosting services (<i>e.g.</i> GitHub pages, Netlify), the
    need for renting a server for the database server is eliminated.</p>

    <p>Decentralised networks such as IPFS can also benefit from client-side
    databases for the same reasons stated above. "Client"-side database access
    fits closer to the peer-to-peer toppology of such networks as opposed to a
    client-server model of the (traditional) Web.</p>

    <h2>When is this a bad idea?</h2>
    <p>While the solution presented here is much more efficient (in terms of
    data transfer) than pushing the whole database to the clients, it is still
    significantly less efficient than returning the results of a query only.
    Though it must be noted that subsequent queries often do not need more to be
    downloaded so on average it shall compensate.</p>

    <p>File system access will still be faster, so if your intended use case
    is to retrieve rows by their <em>unique</em> identifiers, you might want to consider
    using a directory structure where files are identified by the information
    embedded in their path.</p>

    <p>sql.js is still not mature enough to be fully reliable, so its use is
    discouraged for critical services. You might also encounter problems with
    large databases (> 1 GiB, approximately) for reasons currently unknown.
    </p>

    <p>Lastly, this offers a read-only access to the database so modifications
    would not be possible.</p>

    <h2>How can I use this?</h2>
    <p>TODO</p>
